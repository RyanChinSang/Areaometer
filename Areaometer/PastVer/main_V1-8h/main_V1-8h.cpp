-Fixed version name

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
19.02.15 V1.8a
1-Implement getline (cin, Xxxx) where Xxxx is var name. This is a much more effective way of collecting input.
2-Replaced all cin << with getline(cin, 
#1&2 fixes [old]TODO#6 completely ("6-Add message that indicates the program needs to flush memory (eg. when "how to" is entered instead of "howto" in [Input-> Help]")
3-Implement stringstream with <sstream> to allow for the above to be properly implemented when entering a dimension for the shape (int -> stringstream(sDim) )
4-Implementation of above vastly improved error tolerance for TODO#1!! Program does not break if string is intered as a dimension fo sDim!!
5-Used a more precise way of variable initialization by defining each as necessary **HAS COMMENTED CODE**
6-Moved PI from its intialization on if ShapeID is circle to beginning of main
7-Numbered and editied TO DO and edited Version Info (wrong change said in V1.1 changelogs)
8-[visual] Begin numbered convention to changes in changelogs (active 19.02.15)
9-Initialized (at start) all dimension float as 0 so as to ensure last valid sDim values per dimension arent used in new calculations if non--number input is given in other calcs 
10-Added a NOTES section after TO DO to keep track of thoughts
11-[visual] Begin new version name convention VX.xy where y is a lower case letter to signify smaller changes (runtime text or comment editing or any [visual] tags)
12-Fixed version name under new convention
13-[visual] Moved TO DO outside of Version Info outline 

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
23.02.15 V1.8b
1-[visual] Moved all using std:: shortcuts to before main - making it universal
2-VERY primitive memory implementation... just added header and vars
3-Fixed version name under new convention

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
03.03.15 V1.8c
1-[visual] Removed all duplicates for decisions eg. ShapeID == "1" || ShapeID == "one" -changed to- ShapeID == "1" || "one"
2-[visual] Removed some unuseful commented code
REV1; Reverted 1 because it no longer distinguised the different set of values for the varibale
3-Changed output condition, now Area will show Areas >=0 and <-1, but if Area = -1, it will not output!!
4-Added some of the (primitive) paste to memory code, and made memory file named PrimMem.txt
5-By mistake, had to re-outline all the sectioning of the code, may be changed alittle now....
NULL3; 6 makes 3 null
6-Fixed completely "11-Allow Area to show Area = -1 thorugh calculations, but NOT through any other means." by removing the condition alltogether
7-Implement working, but semi-functional re-paste from memory txt
8-Fixed uneven spacing for ShapeID 2
9-Fixed version name

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
08.03.15 V1.8d
1-[visual] Removed all "//skip a line" and "// skip a line" comments, to make code look less jumbled
NULL[V1.8c #5]; [V1.8d #2] makes [V1.8c #5] null
2-[visual] Redo the sectioning (don't know why it removed again)
3-Added a tags section, to keep tract of where the relevant code is put, can use Ctrl+F function to find them within main
4-Moved goto resumeCirc to fix NOTES#4 ("4-For memory code, for a circle, when options is changed to diameter, and then calculations flow, the memory code shows (correct values) as if it never changed and still shows radius (should show diameter)")
5-To facilitate 4 properly, added conditional statement to write mem code for radius only if diameter mode is off
6-[visual] Changed various comments throughout the code (wording, spelling, formatting)
7-Changed position of return 0, now it is the very last line in main - as it should be
8-Added mem code restart formatting
9-Removed goto start; for when ShapeID == back et. al.
10-Added mem code for ShapeID == back
11-Added mem code for ShapeID == list
12-Rebuild? Fixed [old]TODO#10 ("10-Fix getline is ambiguous?!")
13-Changed help mode to clear screen
14-Added goto point "mem" for repasting code from PrimMem.txt (used from help to base code in options)
15-Added mem repaste for help mode for helpID == back (just as in options) by using goto mem
16-Added IDcls = Help for help mode, before repaste (although IDcls functionality isn't working yet)
17-Fixed some error in formatting with repasting from memory
18-Added mem code for error: and restart: in ShapeID
19-Added conditionals for those, because its also used in options and in help mode (commented - doest work)
20-Primitive memory implementation sucessfull! {[V1.8b] #2, [V1.8c] #7, [V1.8d] #4,5,8,10to17} Fixed [old]TODO#7&8 completely (see below for quotes)
("7-**SystemCLS mode WILL REQUIRE MEMORY (store in array (all user inputs and resultant calculations), or create a temporary text file to serve as memory)")
("8-***Display the SystemCLS mode memory in some meaningful fashion")
21-Renamed "Version Info:" to ">>> VERSION >>>"
22-Fixed minor mem repaste formatting in #10
23-Removed PUC in both help->back and options->back code
24-[visual] Formatted some more code at the start of main (logo)
25-Fixed version name

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
12.03.15 V1.8e
1-Removed IDcls conditional from start of code (logo) and placed that "Back from mode" to memory straight with the "Went to mode"
#1 Fixes [old]TODO#9) not completely
("9-*Get conditional above logo working (IDcls functionality)")
2-Refilled infoID == "Xxxx" || infoID == "Xxxy" (from revert on V1.8c)
3-Removed [old] memory code that runs outside of other modes - [CNF] will pick up later on memShapeID related funtionality
4-Added new string variable "Mode" to distinguish which mode is used, to aid with 5
5-Refined error tolerance for when in options and in help mode - you now don't restart anymore on inputing invalid command
6-Removed [old]Options#3 "[3 - Reset or Restart Areaometer]" and combined with [FUC] [old]Options#4 "[4 - Clear Areaometer Screen]"
7-Removed all occurances of 'memShapeID', since 'mode' already serves that functonality
8-Added goto options: to restart options mode if needed
9-Added errorID, and goto backinclearID, backindiaID and backinunits for increased error tolerance and Options feels more like a mode now.
10-Added a check to prompt the user if to accept the change of units in Options mode.
11-Added more CLS implementation in various places in Options mode
12-Much formatting, and error tolerance improvements while in Options Mode. Removed [FUC] and [PUC] tags
13-Changed description of the options in Help mode.
14-Added go to options, backinOptions and backininfoID
15-More formatting in Help mode. Makes Help mode more like a mode now (independance).
16-Fixed version name

30-Fixed version name

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
19.03.15 V1.8g (Cleaning code from big update)
1-Removed initializing of functions at start of code; since they are before main anyway
2-Moved ifstream and ofstream vars outside of main - made them universal (in Using.h)
3-Moved functions PolyName and PolyArea into header files (Poly_Name.h and Poly_Area.h respectively)
4-Moved memory code into a function "void Memory()"
5-Removed "using namespace std;" to using std:: for string, ifstream, ofstream and stringstream

[MC]  = Memory Code; the code that is being wrtten to PrimMem.txt
[PUC] = Potential Unnecessary Code; lines of code that are "commented-off" for some reason

[CNF] = Code Needs Fixing; code that needs fixing may or may not be commented, and is likely due to logic errors

>>> TO DO >>>

[V1.8]   [[Memory implemetation phase and added functionality]]
1-Add improved error tolerance (eg. report error and force re-enter if sDim is a string)
2-Make some sort of realistic units library for #3
3-Force the user to enter only "m" or "cm" (report error and force re-enter if Units does not obey standard set of Units library)
4-*Use SystemCLS to make interface much cleaner and program-like
5-Clean all unuseful commented code [PUC] and [FUC]
6-Fix all [CNF]
7-Add "back" functionality for all sub prompts
8-Add "history" funtion - so not loading to ROM, but keeps track of everything in [Input]

[V1.9]   [[Colour implementation phase and addded funtionality]]
1-Add colour
2-Add sound for error

[AIM] Version 2.0 to have memory, colour, (error)sound and much functionality!
[V1.8] - Memory implemetation phase and added functionality
[V1.9] - Colour and sound implementation phase, more added funtionality
[V2.0] - Success of all the above (once V1.9y chain is done)

>>> NOTES >>>

1-For memory code, if the user enters a string for sDim, since outfile uses the integer from stringstream, it does not recognize the string
